# Normal  
Actually make a real readme  
Add settings page to disable automated messaging (wound/lock and such) or send them to self instead.  
Add settings page to add bonuses to add universal bonuses to dye/do.  
Add setting to colors to add default bonuses to dye/do/recover. (autofill the prompt)  
Fix color drag/drop. It broke at some point and will be useful in the future.  

# Long Term  
Add/Steal a status system to put icons over tokens.  

Add a token image management system that supports automatic overlays when locking in a swing, add a token image tab to the sheet for one click changes as well.  
  
Add modifier system to gifts. When equipped, it will add an extra modifier to do/dye/recovers that is toggleable in the dialogue. Drag in colors to make them only apply to rolls involving the matching colors.  
  
Clean up all the unused code from boilerplate, and organize the mess.
